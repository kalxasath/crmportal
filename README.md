# crmportal
Dynamics CRM custom MVC portal starter project.

## Why?
Although powerful, the out of the box Dynamics Portal or AdxStudio customisation flexibility is quite limited.
For a complex Dynamics CRM customer portal, a custom built ASP MVC web site might be a better choice. 
This project is intended to be a starter template with a custom Asp Identity user store implemented.

## How?
User credentials are stored in Contact entity.
User roles, logins, claims are stored in appropriate custom entities.
